![How Tembo Works](/images/how-tembo-works.png)

Tembo is a proactive AI software engineer that accelerates your team's productivity to the max.

It executes engineering tickets, fixes bugs in production, improves database performance, and generally enhances your codebase â€” while your engineers focus on building new features and reviewing PRs from anywhere.

## What Tembo does:

- **Executes engineering tickets** â€” You can assign tickets from Linear, Jira, etc to Tembo (or it can watch for specific tags), and it will take a first crack at writing code to solve the ticket.

- **Fixes bugs in production** â€” It will watch your error tracking tools (like Sentry and Datadog) continuously â€” for errors that can be fixed easily by a simple code commit.

- **Writes code to improve database performance** â€” It will watch your database query performance, and suggest changes to the code or indexing to speed up your applications.

- **Improves your codebase** â€” Once a week, it will look at each of your repos, to identify technical debt, security vulnerabilities, and opportunities for refactoring â€” and send in a few PRs for the low hanging fruit.

## What your engineers do:

- **Review, approve, improve and merge PRsâ€”from anywhere** ðŸ™‚ No text editor needed (sometimes you can just click a button to approve the PR).

## How it works

Tembo works 24/7 across your entire development stack:

1. **Monitor continuously** - Watch your code, database, and error tracking tools
2. **Detect and prioritize** - Identify issues that can be fixed with code changes
3. **Generate solutions** - Write clean, tested code that follows your repo's patterns
4. **Submit for review** - Create production-ready PRs for your team to approve

Tembo operates in two modes:

- **Autonomous**: Detects and fixes issues automatically
- **Assigned**: Takes on specific tickets you assign from Linear, Jira, etc.
