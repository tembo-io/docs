description: "An AI agent that autonomously solves production Postgres issues"
---

**dba** is an AI Agent that identifies issues in your production Postgres, and
attempts to solve these issues directly in your codebase autonomously.

It sends pull requests for solutions that it's confident in, and works as your co-pilot to solve other issues.

<Info>
  **dba** is in invite-only private alpha testing. For early access, email
  hi@dba.ai.

## Architecture

dba is the first autonomous AI agent that closes the gap between database monitoring and software engineering.
