## Meet Your Superhuman Engineer

Tembo's agent is a full-stack software maintenance engineer powered by AI. It contains a sophisticated a system that finds, fixes, and files clean, production-ready code. \
\
Tembo's built on:

- A powerful language model tuned for maintenance
- Real-time signal ingestion from tools like Sentry and Datadog
- A review-quality PR generation engine

It’s the tireless junior deveveloper who actually closes tickets. 

## How the Agent Works

Tembo turns noisy alerts and performance signals into real code fixes:

1. **Ingests Signals**

   Pulls from logs, error trackers, and database metrics (e.g. Sentry, Datadog)
2. **Triages Autonomously**\
   Detects root causes, prioritizes issues, and builds a fix plan without waiting for a ticket
3. **Writes Pull Requests**\
   Generates clean, merge-ready PRs that align with your repo’s best practices
4. **Seeks Approval**\
   You stay in control — approve, reject, or modify the fix before it merges

## Tembo's Favorite Fixes

Tembo starts where your backlog ends — with the bugs your team doesn't have time to fix:

- Sentry errors and stack traces
- Slow or inefficient queries
- Missing or misused indexes
- Broken windows and recurring alerts
- Misconfigured settings or parameters
- Bad default behaviors that hurt performance

> Tembo is designed to clean up the mess that AI-generated code (and rushed humans) leave behind.

## The Teammate That Gets Better Every Day

Tembo learns and adapts as it works:

- **Context-aware learning** from your codebase, stack, and issue history
- **Cross-team intelligence** from similar fixes applied across the platform
- **Human-in-the-loop feedback** to improve future PR quality
- **Regular updates** from the latest database, observability, and performance researc

## Interacting With Tembo

Use Tembo on your terms:

- **Slack:** Get alerts and fixes where your team already lives
- **GitHub:** Review PRs as if they came from a wildly intelligent junior teammate
- **Web Dashboard:** See what’s been fixed, what’s coming next, and approve changes

### Natural Language Queries

Tembo supports natural language questions about your software:

```
“Why is write latency spiking during peak hours?”
“What’s the root cause of this Sentry error?”
“How can I speed up this endpoint?”
```

### Solution Review and Approval

While Tembo can work autonomously, you maintain control through your workflow toggle:

1. The agent detects an issue and generates a solution
2. You receive a notification with details and recommendations
3. You can approve, reject, or modify the proposed solution
4. Upon approval, the agent implements the changes

## Enterprise Integration

Tembo works seamlessly across modern enterprise workflows:

- Git-native pull request lifecycle
- Audit logging for every fix
- Slack-based approvals
- Private deployments available
- Future support for:
  - Change management workflows
  - Multi-tiered approvals
