  <Accordion title="What is dba.ai?">
    dba.ai is an AI-powered PostgreSQL database assistant that continuously monitors your database, detects issues, and provides solutions automatically. It combines deep PostgreSQL expertise with AI capabilities to help teams maintain optimal database performance without requiring dedicated database administrators.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="What managed PostgreSQL providers do you support?">
  dba.ai supports multiple PostgreSQL providers: - [AWS RDS for
  PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/) - [Tembo
  Cloud](https://cloud.tembo.io) - [Supabase](https://supabase.com) -
  Self-hosted PostgreSQL via direct connection string We're constantly adding
  more cloud providers. Contact us if your provider isn't listed.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="How does dba.ai connect to my database?">
  dba.ai offers several secure connection methods: - **Direct connection** using
  a standard PostgreSQL connection string - **AWS IAM integration** for enhanced
  RDS capabilities - **GitHub integration** for code-based fixes - **Cloud
  provider API integrations** for deeper system-level insights All connections
  use TLS encryption and follow the principle of least privilege with read-only
  access by default.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Is dba.ai secure?">
  Yes, security is a core principle of dba.ai: - All connections are encrypted
  using TLS - We recommend using read-only database users - No sensitive data is
  extracted from your database - We follow SOC 2 security best practices - Your
  database credentials are encrypted at rest - We never store query results
  Learn more in our [security documentation](/account/security).
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="What PostgreSQL versions are supported?">
  dba.ai supports PostgreSQL versions 10 and above. We recommend using the
  latest stable version (currently PostgreSQL 16) for access to all features and
  optimizations. The AI agent adjusts its recommendations based on your specific
  PostgreSQL version.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Can't <Cursor|Lovable|Github Copilot> just do this?">
  Yes and no. Horizontal AI engineers are designed to handle any coding task you
  throw at them. But **you** have to do the throwing. This human-led workflow is
  great for new products and new features. Coding agents can fix performance
  issues too, if you specifically ask them to. But you likely won't, because
  you're consumed with building new features and (reluctantly) fixing bugs.
  dba.ai handles performance engineering autonomously â€” detecting issues,
  gathering context and best practices, and submitting code fixes to you. It's
  not magic, it's just a continuous engine with the right inputs that produces
  excellent PRs.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="How does dba.ai detect database issues?">
  dba.ai uses multiple detection methods: 1. **Metric monitoring** - Tracking
  database performance metrics over time 2. **Log analysis** - Processing
  PostgreSQL logs for errors and warnings 3. **Query profiling** - Identifying
  slow or problematic queries 4. **Configuration analysis** - Checking for
  suboptimal PostgreSQL settings 5. **Resource utilization** - Monitoring CPU,
  memory, and disk usage When an issue is detected, the AI analyzes the root
  cause and generates appropriate solutions.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="How does dba.ai implement fixes?">
  dba.ai provides several implementation methods based on your preferences: 1.
  **GitHub pull requests** - Code-based fixes submitted as PRs 2. **SQL script
  generation** - Ready-to-run SQL scripts with your approval 3. **Configuration
  recommendations** - Detailed guides for settings changes 4. **Manual
  guidance** - Step-by-step instructions for complex issues You always have full
  control to review and approve any changes before they're applied.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="How do you keep the AI models up-to-date with the latest documentation?">
  dba.ai leverages powerful foundation models from Anthropic and OpenAI,
  combined with our specialized knowledge base. We continuously update our
  knowledge with: - Official PostgreSQL documentation - PostgreSQL mailing lists
  and forums - Academic research papers - Industry best practices - Real-world
  case studies - Community contributions This ensures our recommendations
  reflect the latest PostgreSQL techniques and best practices.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Can I use dba.ai with my existing monitoring tools?">
  Yes, dba.ai complements your existing monitoring stack: -
  **Prometheus/Grafana** - Extract additional insights from your metrics - **AWS
  CloudWatch** - Integrate with your existing AWS monitoring - **Application
  monitoring tools** - Correlate database issues with application performance
  dba.ai doesn't replace your existing tools but adds AI-powered analysis and
  recommendations on top of them.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Do I need database expertise to use dba.ai?">
  No, dba.ai is designed to be accessible to developers without specialized
  database knowledge. The AI explains issues and solutions in clear language,
  providing educational context alongside recommendations. However, teams with
  database expertise can still benefit from the automation and continuous
  monitoring capabilities while maintaining full control over implementation
  decisions.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Can I bring my own LLM key?">
  Not yet. LLM rate limits are dba.ai's primary product bottleneck. If you're
  willing to bring your own Anthropic key, you'll get a fastpass through the
  waitlist and enhanced prioritization for operations.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Is there a free trial?">
  Yes, dba.ai offers a 14-day free trial with full access to all features. No
  credit card is required to start your trial. After the trial period, you can
  choose from our flexible pricing plans based on your needs.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="How is dba.ai different from managed PostgreSQL services?">
  Managed PostgreSQL services provide the database infrastructure but still
  require significant expertise to optimize. dba.ai works alongside these
  services, adding: 1. **Proactive issue detection** before they impact users 2.
  **Autonomous problem-solving** without human intervention 3.
  **Database-specific AI chat** for natural language interaction 4. **Contextual
  recommendations** tailored to your specific database 5. **Code-level fixes**
  submitted directly to your repositories
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Can dba.ai help with database migrations?">
  Yes, dba.ai can assist with PostgreSQL migrations by: - Analyzing
  compatibility issues between versions - Recommending schema changes for new
  versions - Identifying deprecated features in your codebase - Suggesting
  performance optimizations for the new version - Monitoring post-migration
  performance Contact us for specialized assistance with complex migrations.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Are there size limits for code indexing?">
  Code repositories are limited to 10,000 files per repository, though this can
  be adjusted for enterprise plans. To optimize indexing performance, you can
  use .dbaignore to exclude unnecessary files (like node_modules, vendor
  directories, etc.) from the indexing process.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Can one database be linked to multiple code repos?">
  Yes, you can map databases to multiple code repositories, and vice versa. It's
  a many-to-many relationship, which is particularly useful for microservices
  architectures where multiple services interact with the same database.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Does dba.ai work with PostgreSQL extensions?">
  Yes, dba.ai supports common PostgreSQL extensions including: - PostGIS for
  geospatial data - pgvector for vector embeddings - TimescaleDB for time-series
  data - pg_stat_statements for query analysis - And many others The AI agent
  will provide extension-specific recommendations when appropriate.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="How often does dba.ai check my database?">
  By default, dba.ai performs: - Real-time monitoring of critical metrics -
  Hourly checks for performance issues - Daily analysis for optimization
  opportunities - Weekly index and vacuum maintenance recommendations You can
  adjust these frequencies in your account settings based on your needs.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the disposition of dba.ai? Is it cheerful or grumpy?">
    ðŸ˜‚ dba.ai has the demeanor of an experienced database professional: knowledgeable, slightly sarcastic at times, but ultimately helpful and focused on solving problems. You'll find it refreshingly direct, occasionally witty, and always informative.
