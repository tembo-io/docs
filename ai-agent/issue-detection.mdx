## How Issue Detection Works

Tembo monitors your connected PostgreSQL databases, collecting key metrics and log data to identify potential problems. The system uses a combination of:

1. **Metric Analysis**: Monitoring performance metrics like CPU usage, memory, I/O, and database-specific metrics
2. **Log Analysis**: Scanning PostgreSQL logs for errors, warnings, and other signs of trouble
3. **Query Performance**: Tracking slow queries and identifying optimization opportunities
4. **Configuration Analysis**: Reviewing your PostgreSQL configuration for potential improvements

When an issue is detected, Tembo:

1. Analyzes the root cause using AI
2. Classifies the severity of the issue
3. Generates potential solutions
4. Creates a detailed report with actionable recommendations

## Types of Issues Detected

Tembo can identify and help resolve a wide range of PostgreSQL issues, including:

### Performance Issues

- Slow queries
- Index opportunities
- Connection bottlenecks (coming soon)
- Resource constraints (coming soon)

### Configuration Issues

- Suboptimal PostgreSQL parameters (coming soon)
- Memory allocation problems (coming soon)
- Inefficient work_mem or shared_buffers settings (coming soon)

### Data Management Issues

- Bloat in tables or indexes (coming soon)
- Missing vacuum operations (coming soon)
- Stale statistics (coming soon)

### Security Issues

- Exposed endpoints (coming soon)
- Overly permissive roles (coming soon)
- Missing encryption (coming soon)

## Issue Resolution Workflow

When Tembo detects an issue, it follows this workflow:

1. **Detection**: The issue is identified through metrics, logs, or other monitoring
2. **Analysis**: AI analyzes the issue, considering your specific database context
3. **Solution Generation**: Multiple potential solutions are developed
4. **Recommendation**: The best solution is recommended, with explanations for why it's preferred
5. **Implementation**: You can approve the fix for automatic implementation or apply it manually

### Automated Pull Requests

For GitHub-connected database repositories, Tembo can:

1. Generate a fix as code
2. Create a branch in your repository
3. Submit a pull request with the proposed fix
4. Add detailed explanations for reviewers

This allows your team to review the proposed changes using your normal code review process.

## Setting Alert Preferences

You can customize how and when you're notified about issues:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Alert Preferences**
2. Configure alert thresholds by severity
3. Choose notification channels (email, Slack, etc.)
4. Set quiet hours if needed

## Issue History and Learning

Tembo maintains a history of all detected issues and their resolutions, which:

1. Helps track recurring problems
2. Allows the system to learn from previous solutions
3. Provides documentation for audit purposes
4. Informs proactive recommendations

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Issue Rules

You can create custom rules for your specific environment:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Custom Rules**
2. Define trigger conditions
3. Set actions to take when conditions are met
4. Save and activate your rule

### Integration with Monitoring Tools

Tembo will soon integrate with existing monitoring tools.
