## How Maintenance Detection Works 

Tembo connects directly to the tools already monitoring your stack — like **Sentry**, **Datadog**, and **Postgres logs** — and listens for issues as they arise. Instead of pinging engineers with alerts, it triages problems, traces root causes, and writes PRs to fix them.

**Tembo’s pipeline looks like this:**

1. **Ingest signals**\
   Pulls real-time errors, performance metrics, and traces from your observability stack.
2. **Analyze context**\
   Uses your application code, stack traces, and past issue patterns to understand what’s going wrong — and why.
3. **Generate solutions**\
   Writes potential code-level fixes tailored to your actual tech stack and repo structure.
4. **Submit a pull request**\
   Pushes clean, review-ready PRs into your existing Git workflows for approval.

## Types of Maintenance Opportunities

The superhuman developer reacts to production issues wherever they surface.

### Application Bugs

- Errors from tools like Sentry (e.g. null references, uncaught exceptions)
- Stack traces from crashes and exceptions
- Runtime issues like type mismatches or broken logic

### Performance Problems

- Slow database queries from Postgres (via logs or `pg_stat_statements`)
- Inefficient endpoints
- N\+1 queries and redundant computation
- Memory or CPU spikes (via Datadog or OpenTelemetry)

### Configuration & Best Practices

- Misused libraries or deprecated patterns
- Unsafe or unscalable defaults in app or infra code
- Repetitive patterns Tembo can refactor or improve

## Pull Request Generation

Once an issue is detected, Tembo:

- Builds a clear, code-based fix
- Writes a detailed pull request
- Routes it through your GitHub workflows
- Awaits your approval, just like a junior engineer would

## Customizing Tembo's Workflow

Tembo learns from your repo, team preferences, and past approvals. Your team can:

- Set thresholds for which issues Tembo acts on
- Enable/disable categories of issues (e.g. performance only, not style)
- Define approval paths and codeowners for sensitive areas
- Filter by severity or business impact

## Coming Soon: Unified Signal Ingestion

We’re working on deeper integrations with tools like:

- Datadog, OpenTelemetry, Prometheus (infra & app perf)
- Jira, Linear (ticket-based tracking)
- AWS, GCP, and other cloud telemetry systems
