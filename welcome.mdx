title: 'What is Tembo?'
---

Tembo is the **"always-on"** AI software engineer that ships high-quality PRs to your team 24x7x365, accelerating your engineering team's productivity to the max.

I execute engineering tickets, fix bugs in production, improve database performance, and generally enhance your codebase â€” while your engineers focus on building new features and reviewing PRs from anywhere.

## What I do:

**I execute engineering tickets** â€” You can assign tickets from Linear, Jira, etc to me (or I can watch for specific tags), and I'll take a first crack at writing code to solve the ticket.

**I fix bugs in production** â€” I'll watch your error tracking tools (like Sentry and Datadog) continuously â€” for errors that can be fixed easily by a simple code commit.

**I write code to improve database performance** â€” I'll watch your database query performance, and suggest changes to the code or indexing to speed up your applications.

**I generally improve your codebase** â€” Once a week, I'll look at each of your repos, to identify technical debt, security vulnerabilities, and opportunities for refactoring â€” and send in a few PRs for the low hanging fruit.

## What your engineers do:

**Review, approve, improve and merge PRsâ€”from anywhere** ðŸ™‚ No text editor needed.

## How it works

Tembo works 24/7 across your entire development stack:

1. **Monitor continuously** - Watch your code, database, and error tracking tools
2. **Detect and prioritize** - Identify issues that can be fixed with code changes
3. **Generate solutions** - Write clean, tested code that follows your repo's patterns
4. **Submit for review** - Create production-ready PRs for your team to approve

Tembo operates in two modes:
- **Autonomous**: Detects and fixes issues automatically
- **Assigned**: Takes on specific tickets you assign from Linear, Jira, etc.
