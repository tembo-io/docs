<Update label="2025-06-20" tags={["Task Prioritization", "CI/CD", "Automation"]}>

## Task Prioritization

Write a quick prompt about what you're trying to achieve and Tembo will rank your open tasks by impact. It learns from titles, labels, commit history and surfaces what's worth tackling first.

Tembo now reacts to failed workflows. Broken tests, failed lints â€“ it finds the issue and pushes a fix. No more chasing red pipelines.

## Improvements

A bunch of bug fixes and polish across the board.

## Feedback Loop in PRs

This one's huge. Leave a review or single comments â€” Tembo will now respond to all of them in one go. Way less back and forth, way faster iteration.

## Model Selection
