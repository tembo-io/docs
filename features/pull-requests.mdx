Tembo automatically creates a pull request when its work is complete. You can trigger its work automatically through integrations like [Sentry](/integrations/sentry) or database monitoring, or through manual assignment with a ticket in [Linear](/integrations/linear).

## How It Works

1. **Issue Triggered** - Either automatically detected from Sentry/database monitoring, or manually assigned via Linear issues
2. **Generates Solution** - Analyzes your codebase and creates appropriate fixes
3. **Creates PR** - Submits with clear descriptions and context
4. **You Review** - Standard GitHub workflow with [Feedback Loop](/features/feedback-loop)

## What Triggers Tembo PRs

**Automatic Detection:**
- **Sentry errors** and application crashes
- **Database performance issues** like slow queries or missing indexes
- **Code quality problems** detected through analysis

**Manual Assignment:**
- **[Linear](/integrations/linear) issues** assigned to Tembo
- **[Jira](/integrations/jira) issues** with Tembo labels or assignments
- **Direct requests** for specific improvements

## Tembo's Pull Requests

Tembo's pull requests are created with the following characteristics:

- **Clear descriptions** of the problem and solution approach
- **Focused changes** that follow your coding standards through [Rule Files](/features/rule-files)
- **Context links** to original errors, issues, or performance metrics
- **Tests** when appropriate for the change type
