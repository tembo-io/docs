Tembo automatically creates a pull request when its work is complete. You can trigger its work automatically through integrations like [Sentry](/integrations/sentry) or database monitoring, or through manual assignment with a ticket in [Linear](/integrations/linear).

## How It Works

1. **Issue Triggered** - Either automatically detected from Sentry/database monitoring, or manually assigned via Linear issues
2. **Generates Solution** - Analyzes your codebase and creates appropriate fixes
3. **Creates PR** - Submits with clear descriptions and context
4. **You Review** - Standard GitHub workflow with [Feedback Loop](/features/feedback-loop)

## What Triggers Tembo PRs

### Automatic Detection

- **Sentry errors** and application crashes
- **Database performance issues** like slow queries or missing indexes
- **Code quality problems** detected through analysis

### Manual Assignment

#### Direct Requests

Create tasks directly through the Tembo dashboard for specific improvements.

- **Single repository**: Select a specific repository from the dropdown, or use **Auto detect** to have Tembo automatically identify the most appropriate repository for your task using AI
- **Multiple repositories**: Select multiple repositories from the dropdown when your task spans across different codebases (e.g., frontend and backend changes)

#### Linear Issues

Assign [Linear](/integrations/linear) issues using Tembo labels.

![Linear label selection](/images/linear-label-selection.png)

- **Default repository**: Use the `Tembo` label to work with your default repository (set in Tembo settings)
- **Auto-detect repository**: Use the `tembo/auto` label to have Tembo automatically identify the most appropriate repository using AI
- **Specific repositories**: Use `tembo/{repo}` labels (e.g., `tembo/frontend`, `tembo/backend`) to target specific repositories
- **Multiple repositories**: Add multiple `tembo/{repo}` labels to work across several repositories simultaneously

#### Jira Issues

Assign [Jira](/integrations/jira) issues to Tembo with appropriate labels or assignments.

## Tembo's Pull Requests

Tembo's pull requests are created with the following characteristics:

- **Clear descriptions** of the problem and solution approach
- **Focused changes** that follow your coding standards through [Rule Files](/features/rule-files)
- **Context links** to original errors, issues, or performance metrics
- **Tests** when appropriate for the change type

You maintain complete control - Tembo provides solutions, you decide what gets merged.
