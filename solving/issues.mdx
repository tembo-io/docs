dba will cycle daily through your connected Postgres instances and read signals to detect issues.

Presently, dba detects slow queries, query errors, and n+1 queries.

These issues will automatically appear in the [issues dashboard](https://dba.ai/issues) and be passed on for attempted autonomous solving.
