1. Analyzes your postgres metadata to generate issues
1. Attempts to solve these issues autonomously
1. Sends pull requests for solutions that it's confident in
1. Works as your co-pilot to solve issues (the issues it cannot autonomously solve)

  **dba** is in private alpha testing. For early access, email support@tembo.io.
