## Tembo Compute Credits

To begin getting pull requests, you'll need to purchase Tembo Compute Credits, however **no monthly commitment is required**.

**40 Tembo Compute Credits (TCCs) cost $40.**

40 credits will generate roughly 40 pull requests, depending on complexity.

## Usage

You can see your Tembo Compute Credits usage, and purchase additional credits on the [Billing](https://app.tembo.io/settings/billing) page within the Tembo app.

## Auto-Reload

We are actively working on a feature to automatically reload your Tembo Compute Credits when they are running low, up to a maximum monthly limit. Until this feature is available, you can manually reload your Tembo Compute Credits at any time.
