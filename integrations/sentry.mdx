## Sentry integration

Tembo seamlessly integrates with [Sentry](https://sentry.io), an industry-leading error monitoring platform, to provide automatic issue resolution for your applications.

Sentry is an application monitoring platform that helps developers identify, diagnose, and fix software errors in real-time. It provides detailed error reports, stack traces, and context to help you understand what's happening when your application encounters issues.

## How Tembo and Sentry work together

When you connect Sentry to Tembo, our system:

1. Receives error alerts from your Sentry projects
2. Uses AI to analyze the error details and understand the root cause
3. Creates actionable issues in Tembo with appropriate severity levels
4. Generates solution recommendation and pull request if possible

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- An active Sentry account with projects configured
- A GitHub repository connected to your Sentry organization
- Admin privileges in Tembo and Sentry

### Connection Steps

1. **Navigate to Integrations**

   - In your Tembo dashboard, go to your organization settings
   - Select the "Integrations" tab
   - Click on the "Connect" button next to Sentry

2. **Authorize Connection**

   - You'll be redirected to Sentry to authorize Tembo
   - Grant the required permissions to allow Tembo to:
     - Read error data
     - Access project information
     - Receive webhook events

3. **Configure Project Mappings**
   - Once connected, you'll need to map your Sentry projects to GitHub repositories
   - This mapping allows Tembo to create pull requests with fixes for your errors
   - Select the appropriate GitHub repository for each Sentry project you want to monitor

## Using the Integration

After successfully connecting Sentry, Tembo will automatically:

- Monitor incoming errors from your Sentry projects
- Create new issues in Tembo when errors occur
- Analyze errors to determine their severity and suggest fixes
- Generate solution recommendations for fixing the underlying issues

### Managing Project Mappings

You can update your Sentry project to GitHub repository mappings at any time:

1. Go to your organization settings
2. Select the "Integrations" tab
3. Click on "Sentry"
4. Update the project-to-repository mappings as needed

## Security and Permissions

The Sentry integration uses secure OAuth2 authentication and all communication is encrypted. Tembo only requests the minimum permissions needed to function:

- Read access to error data
- Webhook event reception
- Access to project information

No sensitive application data beyond what's included in error reports is accessed or stored by Tembo.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your Sentry integration:

1. **Verify Webhook Status**

   - In Sentry, check if the webhooks are being delivered successfully
   - Sentry will show delivery status and any error messages

2. **Check Project Mappings**

   - Ensure each Sentry project is correctly mapped to a GitHub repository
   - Without proper mapping, Tembo cannot create solution PRs.

3. **Verify Permissions**

   - Confirm that the integration has the necessary permissions in both Sentry and GitHub

4. **Contact Support**
   - If issues persist, contact our support team through the Tembo dashboard

## Disconnecting Sentry

To disconnect the Sentry integration:

1. Go to your organization settings in Tembo
2. Select the "Integrations" tab
3. Find Sentry and click "Disconnect"

You can also revoke access from the Sentry side:

1. Go to your Sentry organization settings
2. Navigate to Developer Settings > Installed Integrations
3. Find Tembo and uninstall it
