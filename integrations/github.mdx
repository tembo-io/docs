## Overview

The GitHub integration allows Tembo to connect with your GitHub repositories and automatically create pull requests when issues are detected and resolved.

GitHub serves as Tembo's primary source control integration, enabling:

- Repository code analysis and scanning
- Automated pull request creation with proposed fixes
- Real-time webhook integration for repository events
- Git operations for branch and commit management

## Features

### Repository Access
- OAuth-based authentication with GitHub
- Access to both public and private repositories
- Automatic repository discovery and synchronization
- Support for organizations and personal accounts

### Pull Request Creation
- Automated pull request creation for detected issues
- Proper branch management with descriptive names
- Detailed PR descriptions explaining proposed changes
- Integration with GitHub's review and approval process

### Issue Detection & Resolution
- **TODO Comments**: Finds and implements TODO items in your codebase
- **Code Quality**: Detects potential bugs and performance issues
- **Database Performance**: Identifies slow queries and suggests optimizations
- **Security Issues**: Scans for common security vulnerabilities
- **Technical Debt**: Identifies refactoring opportunities

### Webhook Integration
- Real-time notifications of repository events
- Automatic synchronization when repositories change
- Support for push, pull request, and issue events

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- GitHub account with repository access
- Repository owner or admin permissions for private repos
- Tembo account with integration permissions

### Installation Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    Go to the [Integrations page](https://app.tembo.io/integrations) in your Tembo dashboard and locate the GitHub integration card.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize GitHub Access">
    Click **Install** and authorize Tembo to access your GitHub account. You can choose to:
    - Grant access to all repositories
    - Select specific repositories only
    
    You'll be redirected back to Tembo after authorization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Repository Synchronization">
    Tembo will automatically sync your available repositories. This process may take a few minutes depending on the number of repositories.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate Repository Monitoring">
    Once syncing completes:
    1. Review the list of discovered repositories
    2. Enable monitoring for repositories where you want Tembo to create PRs
    3. Configure any repository-specific settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Webhook (Automatic)">
    Tembo automatically configures webhooks for enabled repositories to receive real-time updates about repository changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported Issue Types

### Code Analysis Issues
- **TODO Comments**: Implements functionality marked with TODO comments
- **Code Bugs**: Detects and fixes common programming errors
- **Performance Issues**: Identifies inefficient code patterns

### Database Integration Issues
When combined with database integrations (PostgreSQL, AWS RDS, Supabase):
- **Slow Queries**: Optimizes database queries with poor performance
- **Missing Indexes**: Suggests and implements database indexes
- **Unused Indexes**: Removes unnecessary database indexes

### Error Monitoring Integration
When combined with error monitoring (Sentry):
- **Application Errors**: Fixes code issues causing runtime errors
- **Exception Handling**: Improves error handling and recovery

## Configuration Options

### Repository Settings
- **Target Branch**: Configure the main branch for pull requests (typically `main` or `master`)
- **Branch Naming**: Automatic feature branch creation with descriptive names
- **PR Templates**: Use repository's pull request templates when available

### Issue Scanning
- **File Types**: Configure which file types to scan for issues
- **Scan Frequency**: Set how often repositories are scanned for new issues
- **Issue Prioritization**: Configure which types of issues to prioritize

### Pull Request Behavior
- **Auto-merge**: Configure whether PRs should be automatically merged (not recommended)
- **Review Requirements**: Respect repository's branch protection and review settings
- **Labels and Assignments**: Automatically add labels and assign reviewers

## Technical Implementation

### OAuth Configuration
- **Scopes**: `repo` (for private repos) or `public_repo` (for public repos)
- **Permissions**: Read repository content, create branches, create pull requests
- **Webhook Events**: `push`, `pull_request`, `issues`, `repository`

### Git Operations
- Repository cloning and local analysis
- Feature branch creation with consistent naming (`tembo/fix-issue-description`)
- Commit creation with proper author attribution
- Pull request creation with detailed descriptions

### API Integration
- GitHub REST API v3 for repository operations
- GitHub GraphQL API v4 for efficient data querying
- Webhook API for real-time event processing

## Security & Permissions

### Required GitHub Permissions
- **Repository Access**: Read repository content and metadata
- **Branch Management**: Create and manage feature branches
- **Pull Request Creation**: Create and update pull requests
- **Webhook Management**: Configure repository webhooks

### Security Best Practices
- Tembo only accesses repositories you explicitly authorize
- All code analysis happens in secure, isolated environments
- No sensitive data is stored permanently
- OAuth tokens are securely managed and can be revoked at any time

### Branch Protection Compatibility
- Respects existing branch protection rules
- Works with required status checks
- Compatible with required reviews and approval workflows
- Honors dismiss stale reviews and restrict push settings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Repository Not Appearing**:
- Verify you have appropriate permissions
- Check if repository is private and proper scopes are granted
- Try manually syncing integrations

**Pull Requests Not Created**:
- Confirm Tembo has write access to the repository
- Check branch protection settings
- Verify webhook configuration is active

**Webhook Delivery Issues**:
- Check webhook delivery logs in GitHub repository settings
- Verify webhook URL is accessible
- Check for webhook secret configuration

### Best Practices

**Repository Management**:
- Enable repository monitoring selectively based on your team's needs
- Configure appropriate branch protection rules
- Set up code review requirements for automated PRs

**Team Workflow**:
- Communicate with your team about automated PRs
- Establish review processes for Tembo's contributions
- Use labels and assignments to manage automated PRs

**Performance Optimization**:
- Focus monitoring on active development repositories
- Configure scan frequency based on development activity
- Prioritize issue types that provide the most value

## Limitations

- Tembo requires write access to create pull requests
- Large repositories may take longer to sync and analyze
- Some advanced Git features may not be supported
- Webhook delivery depends on GitHub's reliability

## Integration Updates

The GitHub integration is regularly updated with new features:
- Enhanced issue detection algorithms
- Better pull request descriptions and formatting
- Improved webhook reliability and error handling
- Support for additional GitHub features and APIs
