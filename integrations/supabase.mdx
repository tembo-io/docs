The Supabase integration allows Tembo to securely connect to your Supabase Postgres database. Once connected, Tembo can:

- Monitor database performance
- Identify potential issues
- Provide optimization recommendations
- Generate solutions for common PostgreSQL problems

## Prerequisites

- A Supabase account with an active project
- Administrator access to your Supabase project
- Database connection details (available in your Supabase dashboard)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Your Supabase Connection Information

1. Log in to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.io/)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Project Settings** > **Database**
4. Under **Connection Info**, find your connection details:
   - **Host**: The database host
   - **Port**: Usually 5432 for PostgreSQL
   - **Database name**: Your database name
   - **User**: Database username
   - **Password**: Database password

### 2. Connect to Tembo

1. Log in to your Tembo account
2. Navigate to **Connections** > **Add Connection**
3. Select **Supabase** as the connection type
4. Enter your connection details:
   - Connection name (for your reference)
   - Host
   - Port
   - Database name
   - Username
   - Password
5. Click **Test Connection** to verify everything works
6. Click **Create Connection** to save

### 3. Configure Access Permissions

For optimal functionality, Tembo requires certain permissions. We recommend creating a dedicated read-only user for Tembo:

```sql
-- Create a dedicated user for Tembo
CREATE USER tembo WITH PASSWORD '<use-a-secure-generated-password>';

-- Grant read permissions
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE your_database TO tembo;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO tembo;

-- Apply principle of least privilege by granting access only to necessary tables
-- Replace these with the specific tables your monitoring needs access to
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE pg_stat_statements TO tembo;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE pg_stat_activity TO tembo;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE pg_stat_database TO tembo;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE pg_stat_user_tables TO tembo;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE pg_stat_user_indexes TO tembo;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE pg_locks TO tembo;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE pg_class TO tembo;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE pg_index TO tembo;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE pg_settings TO tembo;

-- Grant access to specific sequences if needed
GRANT SELECT ON SEQUENCE seq_name1, seq_name2 TO tembo;

-- Grant access to specific functions if needed
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION func_name1, func_name2 TO tembo;

-- Instead of setting broad default privileges, explicitly grant permissions
-- to new objects as they are created:
-- CREATE TABLE new_table (...);
-- GRANT SELECT ON TABLE new_table TO tembo;
```

## Security Considerations

- Tembo encrypts all connection information at rest
- All database traffic is encrypted using TLS
- Follow the principle of least privilege - grant access only to the specific tables needed for monitoring
- Avoid granting `SELECT ON ALL TABLES` which may expose sensitive data
- Regularly review and audit permissions to ensure they remain appropriate
- No sensitive data is extracted from your database without explicit permission
- For additional security, consider creating filtered views of sensitive tables

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Verify your Supabase project is active
- Check if your IP is allowlisted in Supabase's security settings
- Ensure the database user has sufficient permissions

### Permission Errors

If you encounter permission errors, run the following to view current permissions:

```sql
SELECT grantee, privilege_type
FROM information_schema.table_privileges
WHERE grantee = 'tembo';
```

## Next Steps

After connecting your Supabase database:

1. Set up [issue monitoring](/solving/issues) to receive alerts
2. Configure [automatic pull requests](/solving/pull-requests) for suggested fixes
3. Explore the AI-powered [database chat](/chat) to query your database using natural language
