The Supabase integration allows Tembo to securely connect to your Supabase Postgres database. Once connected, Tembo can:

- Monitor database performance
- Identify potential issues
- Provide optimization recommendations
- Generate solutions for common PostgreSQL problems

## Prerequisites

- A Supabase account with an active project
- Administrator access to your Supabase project
- Database connection details (available in your Supabase dashboard)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Your Supabase Connection Information

1. Log in to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.io/)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Project Settings** > **Database**
4. Under **Connection Info**, find your connection details:
   - **Host**: The database host
   - **Port**: Usually 5432 for PostgreSQL
   - **Database name**: Your database name
   - **User**: Database username
   - **Password**: Database password

### 2. Connect to Tembo

1. Log in to your Tembo account
2. Navigate to **Connections** > **Add Connection**
3. Select **Supabase** as the connection type
4. Enter your connection details:
   - Connection name (for your reference)
   - Host
   - Port
   - Database name
   - Username
   - Password
5. Click **Test Connection** to verify everything works
6. Click **Create Connection** to save

### 3. Configure Access Permissions

For optimal functionality, Tembo requires certain permissions. We recommend creating a dedicated read-only user for Tembo:

```sql
-- Create a dedicated user for Tembo
CREATE USER tembo WITH PASSWORD '<use-a-secure-generated-password>';

-- Grant read permissions
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE your_database TO tembo;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO tembo;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO tembo;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO tembo;
GRANT EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA public TO tembo;

-- Set default privileges for future objects
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO tembo;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON SEQUENCES TO tembo;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTIONS TO tembo;
```

## Security Considerations

- Tembo encrypts all connection information at rest
- All database traffic is encrypted using TLS
- You can limit Tembo's access by using a read-only user
- No sensitive data is extracted from your database without explicit permission

### IP Allowlisting

IP allowlisting is a critical security measure that restricts database access to trusted IP addresses only. To properly configure IP allowlisting in Supabase:

1. Log in to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.io/)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Project Settings** > **Database**
4. Find the **Connection Pooling** section
5. Under **IP Allow List**, add Tembo's IP addresses:
   - For production environments: Add Tembo's static IPs (contact support@tembo.io for the current list)
   - For development: Only add IPs when necessary and remove them when not in use

**Best Practices:**

- Follow the principle of least privilege - only allowlist the specific IPs that need access
- Regularly audit your IP allowlist and remove unused entries
- Use additional authentication methods alongside IP allowlisting
- Never use broad IP ranges (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0) which effectively disables IP filtering
- Document all allowlisted IPs with descriptions and expiration dates if temporary
- Set up alerts for changes to your IP allowlist configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Verify your Supabase project is active
- Check if Tembo's IP addresses are properly allowlisted in Supabase's security settings (see Security Considerations > IP Allowlisting section)
- Ensure the database user has sufficient permissions

### Permission Errors

If you encounter permission errors, run the following to view current permissions:

```sql
SELECT grantee, privilege_type
FROM information_schema.table_privileges
WHERE grantee = 'tembo';
```

## Next Steps

After connecting your Supabase database:

1. Set up [issue monitoring](/solving/issues) to receive alerts
2. Configure [automatic pull requests](/solving/pull-requests) for suggested fixes
3. Explore the AI-powered [database chat](/chat) to query your database using natural language
