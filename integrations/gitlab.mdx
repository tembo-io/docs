<Warning>
GitLab integration is currently in beta and marked as "coming soon" in the codebase. Full functionality may not be available yet.
</Warning>

## Overview

The GitLab integration allows Tembo to connect with your GitLab repositories and automatically create merge requests when issues are detected and resolved.

Similar to the GitHub integration, GitLab provides source control capabilities that enable Tembo to:

- Access repository code for analysis
- Create merge requests with proposed fixes
- Integrate with GitLab's webhook system for real-time updates
- Support both GitLab.com and self-hosted GitLab instances

## Features

### Repository Access
- OAuth-based authentication with GitLab
- Access to repository code and metadata
- Support for private and public repositories
- Automatic repository discovery and synchronization

### Merge Request Creation
- Automated merge request creation for detected issues
- Proper branch management and naming conventions
- Detailed descriptions explaining the proposed changes
- Integration with GitLab's review process

### Webhook Integration
- Real-time notifications of repository events
- Automatic synchronization of repository changes
- Support for merge request lifecycle events

## Setup Instructions

<Info>
GitLab integration setup follows the same OAuth pattern as other integrations but may have limited functionality during the beta period.
</Info>

### Prerequisites

- GitLab account with appropriate repository access
- Repository owner or maintainer permissions
- Tembo account with integration permissions

### Authentication Setup

1. **OAuth Configuration**: The integration uses GitLab's OAuth 2.0 flow
2. **Scope Requirements**: Tembo requires read access to repositories and write access for merge requests
3. **Webhook Setup**: Automatic webhook configuration for repository events

### Repository Selection

After authentication:
1. Tembo syncs available repositories from your GitLab account
2. Select which repositories you want Tembo to monitor
3. Enable monitoring for specific repositories through the dashboard

## Supported Issue Types

The GitLab integration supports the same issue detection and resolution as GitHub:

### Code Quality Issues
- TODO comments implementation
- Code bug detection and fixes
- Performance optimization opportunities

### Database Performance
- Slow query detection (when connected to database integrations)
- Index optimization suggestions
- Query performance improvements

### Application Errors
- Integration with error monitoring tools
- Automated error resolution via merge requests

## Configuration Options

### Branch Management
- Configurable target branch (typically `main` or `develop`)
- Automatic feature branch creation for fixes
- Branch naming conventions following GitLab best practices

### Merge Request Settings
- Automatic merge request creation
- Configurable merge request templates
- Integration with GitLab's approval workflows

### Webhook Configuration
- Automatic webhook setup for repository events
- Configurable event filtering
- Real-time synchronization with GitLab

## Technical Implementation

### OAuth Provider Configuration
- **Base URL**: `https://gitlab.com` (configurable for self-hosted)
- **Authorization URL**: `https://gitlab.com/oauth/authorize`
- **Token URL**: `https://gitlab.com/oauth/token`
- **Required Scopes**: `api`, `read_repository`, `write_repository`

### API Integration
- GitLab REST API v4 for repository operations
- GraphQL API for advanced queries (where supported)
- Webhook API for real-time event processing

### Git Operations
- Repository cloning and branch management
- Commit creation with proper attribution
- Merge request creation and management

## Limitations (Beta)

<Warning>
As this integration is in beta, be aware of potential limitations:
</Warning>

- May have reduced functionality compared to GitHub integration
- Some advanced features might not be fully implemented
- Self-hosted GitLab instances may require additional configuration
- Webhook reliability may vary during beta period

## Best Practices

### Repository Setup
- Ensure proper branch protection rules are configured
- Set up appropriate approval workflows for automated merge requests
- Configure merge request templates for consistency

### Security Considerations
- Review OAuth scopes and permissions carefully
- Monitor automated merge requests for security implications
- Use branch protection rules to prevent unauthorized changes

### Team Workflow
- Communicate with your team about automated merge requests
- Establish review processes for Tembo's contributions
- Configure notifications to stay informed of automated changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**OAuth Authentication Fails**:
- Verify GitLab account permissions
- Check if OAuth application is properly configured
- Ensure network connectivity to GitLab

**Repository Not Syncing**:
- Confirm repository permissions
- Check webhook configuration
- Verify integration is enabled for the repository

**Merge Requests Not Created**:
- Verify write permissions to the repository
- Check branch protection settings
- Ensure target branch exists and is accessible

### Getting Help

For GitLab integration issues:
1. Check the integration status in your Tembo dashboard
2. Review webhook delivery logs in GitLab settings
3. Contact support with specific error messages and repository details

## Future Enhancements

As the GitLab integration moves out of beta, planned enhancements include:

- Enhanced support for GitLab CI/CD integration
- Advanced merge request templates and automation
- Improved support for self-hosted GitLab instances
- Better integration with GitLab's issue tracking system
- Support for GitLab's security and compliance features
