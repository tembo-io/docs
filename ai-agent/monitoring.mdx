## Issue Detection and Monitoring

Tembo continuously monitors your connected systems for performance issues and code problems. Here's how to track and manage what Tembo finds.

## Issue Severity Levels

Tembo automatically assigns severity levels to detected issues using AI analysis:

- **Critical** - Production outages, major performance degradations
- **High** - Significant performance issues, frequent errors
- **Medium** - Moderate performance impacts, code quality issues
- **Low** - Minor optimizations, cleanup tasks

## Issue Types

### Application Issues

**Sentry Errors**

- Pulls errors seen more than once from connected Sentry projects
- Includes full stack traces and error context
- Groups related errors for efficient fixing

**Code Quality Issues**

- TODO comments found in your codebase
- AI-detected bugs and performance issues
- Respects `.temboignore` files for exclusions

**Performance Issues**

- AI-detected performance bottlenecks
- Shows slow endpoints and queries
- Provides optimization suggestions

**Security Issues**

- AI-detected security vulnerabilities
- Shows potential attack vectors
- Provides remediation suggestions

**Dependency Issues**

- AI-detected outdated dependencies
- Shows vulnerable packages and versions

### Database Issues

**Slow Queries**

- Automatically detected from your database
- Includes query text, execution times, and row counts
- Shows slow queries and their impact

**Missing Indexes**

- Identified through query analysis
- Shows which tables/columns would benefit from indexing
- Provides estimated performance improvements

**Unused Indexes**

- Detects indexes that aren't being utilized
- Shows index size and maintenance overhead
- Recommendations for safe removal

## Issue Dashboard

View and manage all detected issues through the Tembo dashboard:

1. **Issue List** - See all open issues with severity and status
2. **Filtering** - Filter by source, severity, or date range
3. **Prioritization** - AI-suggested priority based on impact
4. **Status Tracking** - Monitor progress from detection to resolution

## Issue Lifecycle

1. **Detection** - Tembo discovers an issue through monitoring
2. **Analysis** - AI analyzes the issue and determines severity
3. **Queuing** - Issue is queued for resolution based on priority
4. **Solution** - AI generates a fix and creates a pull request
5. **Review** - You review and approve/reject the proposed solution
6. **Resolution** - Fix is merged and issue is marked resolved

## Managing Issue Resolution

### Approval Workflow

Control how Tembo handles fixes:

- **Manual Approval** - Review each fix before implementation
- **Auto-Approval** - Let Tembo implement low-risk fixes automatically
- **Custom Rules** - Set approval rules based on issue type or severity

### Pull Request Integration

Tembo creates detailed pull requests with:

- Clear description of the issue and fix
- Before/after performance comparisons (when applicable)
- Rollback instructions if needed
- Links to related monitoring data

### Feedback Loop

Help Tembo improve by:

- Approving or rejecting pull requests
- Adding comments on fixes
- Marking false positives
- Requesting additional changes

## Best Practices

**Monitor Regularly**

- Check the dashboard weekly to review detected issues
- Set up notifications for critical issues

**Review Patterns**

- Look for recurring issue types that might indicate systemic problems
- Use issue trends to identify areas needing architectural attention

**Maintain Clean Integrations**

- Ensure your monitoring tools are properly configured
- Keep integration credentials up to date
- Regularly review excluded files and directories

**Collaborate with Your Team**

- Share the dashboard with relevant team members
- Establish clear approval workflows
- Document any custom configuration or exclusions
