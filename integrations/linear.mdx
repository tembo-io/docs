The Linear integration allows Tembo to automatically detect and solve issues from your Linear workspace. Once connected, Tembo can respond to issue assignments and label changes to provide AI-powered code solutions.

## Features

- **Automatic Issue Detection**: Tembo monitors your Linear workspace for new issues and updates
- **AI-Powered Solutions**: When issues are assigned to Tembo or labeled with "tembo", the AI agent analyzes the issue and provides code solutions
- **Repository Linking**: Connect specific Linear issues to GitHub repositories for targeted solutions
- **Webhook Support**: Real-time updates through Linear webhooks for immediate response
- **Credit Management**: Integrated billing system to manage AI solution credits

## Setup

### 1. OAuth Configuration

The Linear integration uses OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication. Configure the following environment variables:

```bash
LINEAR_CLIENT_ID=your_linear_client_id
LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET=your_linear_client_secret
LINEAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
LINEAR_API_KEY=your_api_key  # For feature requests
```

### 2. OAuth Scopes

The integration requires the following Linear API scopes:

- `read` - Read access to workspace data
- `write` - Write access for creating comments and updating issues
- `app:assignable` - Allows the app to be assigned to issues
- `app:mentionable` - Allows the app to be mentioned in comments

### 3. Webhook Configuration

Configure Linear webhooks to send notifications to:

```
POST /webhook/linear
```

Required webhook events:

- Issue updates (label changes, assignments)
- OAuth app revocation

## Usage

### Issue Assignment Method

1. Assign any Linear issue to the Tembo app
2. Tembo will automatically:
   - Create a comment confirming the assignment
   - Queue the issue for AI analysis (if credits available)
   - Update the issue status to "In Progress" when solving begins

### Label Method

1. Add the "tembo" label to any Linear issue
2. Tembo will automatically:
   - Create a comment acknowledging the label
   - Queue the issue for AI analysis (if credits available)

### Repository Linking

1. Connect GitHub repositories during setup
2. Linear labels are automatically created for each repository
3. Add a repository label to an issue to link it to that specific codebase
4. Tembo will focus solutions on the linked repository

## Issue Processing

### Issue States

Tembo syncs with the following Linear workflow states:

- All non-completed and non-canceled states are monitored
- Issues in "completed" or "canceled" states are skipped

### Priority Mapping

Linear priorities are mapped to Tembo severity levels:

| Linear Priority | Tembo Level  | Description       |
| --------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Urgent (1)      | 5 (Critical) | Highest priority  |
| High (2)        | 4 (High)     | High priority     |
| Normal (3)      | 3 (Medium)   | Standard priority |
| Low (4)         | 2 (Low)      | Lower priority    |
| No Priority (0) | 2 (Low)      | Default level     |

### Data Structure

Issues are stored with the following structure:

```typescript
interface LinearIssueData {
	task: string; // Issue title
	description: string; // Issue description
	status: string; // Current workflow state
	data: {
		issue: object; // Full Linear issue object
	};
	context?: object; // Additional context
}
```

## Automatic Labels

### System Labels

Tembo automatically creates the following labels in your Linear workspace:

- **"Tembo"** - Used to trigger AI solutions (alternative to assignment)
- **"Tembo Git Repositories"** - Parent group for repository labels

### Repository Labels

For each connected GitHub repository, Tembo creates:

- A child label under "Tembo Git Repositories"
- Named after the repository
- Linked to the specific codebase for targeted solutions

## API Endpoints

### Feature Requests

Create feature requests directly in Linear:

```http
POST /api/linear
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "summary": "Feature title",
  "description": "Detailed description",
  "user": {
    "id": "user_id",
    "name": "User Name",
    "email": "user@example.com"
  }
}
```

## Webhook Events

### Issue Updates

Triggered when:

- Labels are added/removed (especially "tembo" label)
- Repository labels are added
- Issue assignments change

### Issue Assignments

Triggered when:

- Issues are assigned to the Tembo app
- Automatic comment creation and queuing

### OAuth Revocation

Triggered when:

- OAuth access is revoked
- Automatic cleanup of integration data

## Comments and Notifications

Tembo automatically creates comments in Linear for:

### Assignment/Label Comments

```
@user I am starting work on this task now! [View issue on Tembo](link)
```

### Repository Link Comments

```
@user I have linked the [repository-name](repo-url) repository to this task.
```

### Insufficient Credits

```
@user Insufficient credits. [Buy credits here](billing-link)
```

## Integration Management

### Sync Process

The integration periodically syncs:

- Workflow states → Issue sources
- Labels → Issue sources
- Repository connections → Label relationships

### Credit System

- Each AI solution consumes credits
- Credit balance is checked before queuing issues
- Users are notified when credits are insufficient

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Webhook not receiving events**

   - Verify webhook URL is accessible
   - Check webhook secret configuration
   - Ensure required events are enabled

2. **OAuth authentication failures**

   - Verify client ID and secret
   - Check redirect URI configuration
   - Ensure required scopes are granted

3. **Issues not being processed**

   - Verify "tembo" label exists
   - Check credit balance
   - Review issue assignment to Tembo app

4. **Repository labels not working**
   - Ensure GitHub integration is connected
   - Verify repository permissions
   - Check label creation in Linear workspace

### Debug Information

The integration logs detailed information for troubleshooting:

- Webhook payload processing
- Issue upsert operations
- Credit balance checks
- Label and assignment handling

For additional support, check the application logs for detailed error messages and processing status.
