Create workflows that automatically handle your development work: when an engineering issue occurs, Tembo solves it with AI.

## How Workflows Work

Each workflow follows a simple pattern:
1. Trigger: "When this happens..." (e.g., new bug report, performance issue, label added)
2. Conditions: "If these conditions are met..." (e.g., high priority, specific labels)
3. Actions: "Then do this..." (e.g., analyze, fix, create PR)

## Workflow Settings

Configure through our UI:
- Choose triggers (issues, metrics, alerts)
- Set conditions (priority, labels, teams)
- Define actions (fix, review, notify)
- Control approvals and notifications
