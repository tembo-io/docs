# Assign Jira tickets to Tembo and turn them into PRs

## Setting up the integration

### First, create a new Jira account just for Tembo to use
You have 2 options:

- **Use an email alias**: Invite yourself using a modified email like `youremail+tembo@company_domain.com`.
- **Create a dedicated account**: Ask your IT administrator to set up a new email like `tembo@company_domain.com`.

Click "Invite people to Jira" and invite the new account.

After some time, you'll receive an email invite from Jira.

Accept the email invite and complete the sign-up process. Make sure to use the name "Tembo". This name will show up in all the comments the integration makes.

### Next, connect your Tembo org to your new Jira account
For Non-Enterprise Accounts: In your Tembo account at app.tembo.io, go to Settings > Integrations
For Enterprise Accounts: In your Tembo account at app.tembo.io, go to Enterprise Settings > Connected Accounts
Then, click the "Connect" button under the Jira section.

Make sure that you're logged into the Jira account you created for Tembo earlier (not your own Jira account), when you complete this step.

### Finally, add the Tembo label to an issue!
Add the 'Tembo' label to any issue - you may need to create this label yourself the first time.

Refresh to see Tembo's immediate response. Come back in ~5 minutes for Tembo's full analysis!

To start a session from an issue, click on the link Tembo provides in the comments. Tembo won't start any sessions until you kicked off the session yourself.

Bulk edit and apply the 'Tembo' label to start ticket scoping in parallel.

## Why integrate Tembo with Jira?
Since Tembo has access to your codebase, Tembo can comment on tickets with:

- A summary of the relevant code
- An implementation plan
- Edge cases or questions about the ticket

Use Tembo's analysis to get up to speed, or just click the provided link to have Tembo take a first pass at the PR. Tembo has the self-awareness to report ðŸ”´/ðŸŸ /ðŸŸ¢ confidence estimates too.
