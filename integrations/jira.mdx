The Jira integration allows Tembo to automatically detect and solve issues from your Jira workspace. Once connected, Tembo can respond to issue assignments and label changes to provide AI-powered code solutions.

## Features

- **Automatic Issue Detection**: Tembo monitors your Jira workspace for new issues and updates
- **AI-Powered Solutions**: When issues are assigned to Tembo or labeled with "tembo", the AI agent analyzes the issue and provides code solutions
- **Repository Linking**: Connect specific Jira issues to GitHub repositories for targeted solutions
- **Credit Management**: Integrated billing system to manage AI solution credits

## Setup

### 1. API Configuration

The Jira integration uses API tokens for secure authentication. Configure the following environment variables:

```bash
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your_jira_api_token
JIRA_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.atlassian.net
JIRA_USER_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
```

### 2. API Permissions

The integration requires the following Jira permissions:

- `Browse Projects` - Read access to project data
- `Create Issues` - Write access for creating comments and updating issues
- `Edit Issues` - Update issue fields and assignments
- `Add Comments` - Create comments on issues

## Usage

### Issue Assignment Method

1. Assign any Jira issue to the Tembo user
2. Tembo will automatically:
   - Create a comment confirming the assignment
   - Queue the issue for AI analysis (if credits available)
   - Update the issue status to "In Progress" when solving begins

### Label Method

1. Add the "tembo" label to any Jira issue
2. Tembo will automatically:
   - Create a comment acknowledging the label
   - Queue the issue for AI analysis (if credits available)

### Repository Linking

1. Connect GitHub repositories during setup
2. Jira labels are automatically created for each repository
3. Add a repository label to an issue to link it to that specific codebase
4. Tembo will focus solutions on the linked repository

## Issue Processing

### Issue States

Tembo syncs with the following Jira workflow states:

- All open and in-progress states are monitored
- Issues in "Done", "Closed", or "Resolved" states are skipped

### Priority Mapping

Jira priorities are mapped to Tembo severity levels:

| Jira Priority | Tembo Level  | Description       |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Highest       | 5 (Critical) | Highest priority  |
| High          | 4 (High)     | High priority     |
| Medium        | 3 (Medium)   | Standard priority |
| Low           | 2 (Low)      | Lower priority    |
| Lowest        | 1 (Lowest)   | Minimal priority  |

### Data Structure

Issues are stored with the following structure:

```typescript
interface JiraIssueData {
	task: string; // Issue summary
	description: string; // Issue description
	status: string; // Current workflow state
	data: {
		issue: object; // Full Jira issue object
	};
	context?: object; // Additional context
}
```

## Automatic Labels

### System Labels

Tembo automatically creates the following labels in your Jira workspace:

- **"Tembo"** - Used to trigger AI solutions (alternative to assignment)
- **"Tembo-Git-Repositories"** - Parent group for repository labels

### Repository Labels

For each connected GitHub repository, Tembo creates:

- A label prefixed with "Tembo-Repo-"
- Named after the repository
- Linked to the specific codebase for targeted solutions

## API Endpoints

### Feature Requests

Create feature requests directly in Jira:

```http
POST /api/jira
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "summary": "Feature title",
  "description": "Detailed description",
  "user": {
    "id": "user_id",
    "name": "User Name",
    "email": "user@example.com"
  }
}
```

## Comments and Notifications

Tembo automatically creates comments in Jira for:

### Assignment/Label Comments

```
@user I am starting work on this task now! [View issue on Tembo](link)
```

### Repository Link Comments

```
@user I have linked the [repository-name](repo-url) repository to this task.
```

### Insufficient Credits

```
@user Insufficient credits. [Buy credits here](billing-link)
```

## Integration Management

### Sync Process

The integration periodically syncs:

- Workflow states → Issue sources
- Labels → Issue sources
- Repository connections → Label relationships

### Credit System

- Each AI solution consumes credits
- Credit balance is checked before queuing issues
- Users are notified when credits are insufficient

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API authentication failures**

   - Verify API token is valid
   - Check base URL configuration
   - Ensure user email matches token owner

2. **Issues not being processed**

   - Verify "tembo" label exists
   - Check credit balance
   - Review issue assignment to Tembo user

3. **Repository labels not working**
   - Ensure GitHub integration is connected
   - Verify repository permissions
   - Check label creation in Jira workspace

4. **Permission denied errors**
   - Verify user has required Jira permissions
   - Check project-level permissions
   - Ensure API token has sufficient scope

### Debug Information

The integration logs detailed information for troubleshooting:

- API request processing
- Issue upsert operations
- Credit balance checks
- Label and assignment handling
