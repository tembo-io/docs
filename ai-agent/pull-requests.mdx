Once per day Tembo will attempt to solve issues automously, submitting PRs when it is feels confident that it's come up with a helpful PR.

From there, you can manage the workflow using normal Github procedures. If you merge the PR, it will auto-resolve the related Tembo issue once the issue is demonstrated as clear by the production Postgres signals.
