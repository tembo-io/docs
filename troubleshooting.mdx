## Common Issues and Solutions

### Integration Problems

#### Sentry Connection Issues

**Problem**: Sentry integration shows "connection failed" or no errors are being imported.

**Solutions**:

1. **Check OAuth Authorization**: Ensure you've granted all required permissions during the OAuth flow
2. **Verify Project Mappings**: Each Sentry project must be mapped to a GitHub repository
3. **Webhook Delivery**: In Sentry, check Developer Settings â†’ Webhooks for delivery status
4. **Error Frequency**: Tembo only processes errors seen more than once (`times_seen:>1`)

#### PostgreSQL Connection Problems

**Problem**: Database connection fails or times out.

**Solutions**:

1. **Test Connection String**: Verify your connection string works with `psql`:
   ```bash
   psql "postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db?sslmode=require"
   ```
2. **Check Firewall Rules**: Ensure port 5432 (or your custom port) is accessible
3. **SSL Configuration**: Match SSL settings between your database and connection string
4. **User Permissions**: Verify the database user has required permissions:
   ```sql
   SELECT has_database_privilege('tembo_user', 'your_db', 'CONNECT');
   SELECT has_schema_privilege('tembo_user', 'public', 'USAGE');
   ```

#### GitHub Integration Issues

**Problem**: Pull requests are not being created or pushed to the wrong repository.

**Solutions**:

1. **Repository Access**: Ensure Tembo has write access to the target repository
2. **Branch Protection**: Check if branch protection rules are preventing PR creation
3. **Repository Mapping**: Verify integration sources are mapped to correct repositories
4. **Personal Access Token**: Ensure GitHub tokens haven't expired (if using personal tokens)

### Issue Detection Problems

#### No Issues Being Detected

**Problem**: Tembo shows no detected issues despite having performance problems.

**Possible Causes & Solutions**:

**Missing pg_stat_statements**:

```sql
-- Check if extension is installed
SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_stat_statements';

-- Install if missing (requires superuser)
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;

-- Check if it's tracking queries
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_statements;
```

**Query Thresholds Not Met**:

- Slow queries must have >5 calls and >100ms mean execution time
- Check your query patterns: `SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements WHERE calls > 5 ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC;`

**Insufficient Permissions**:

```sql
-- Grant monitoring role
GRANT pg_monitor TO tembo_user;

-- Check current permissions
SELECT has_function_privilege('tembo_user', 'pg_stat_statements()', 'EXECUTE');
```

#### False Positive Issues

**Problem**: Tembo is flagging queries or code that shouldn't be optimized.

**Solutions**:

1. **Use .temboignore**: Create a `.temboignore` file in your repository root to exclude specific files or patterns:

   ```
   # Ignore generated files
   dist/
   build/
   *.generated.js

   # Ignore specific files
   legacy-code.sql
   temp-scripts/
   ```

2. **Mark Issues as False Positives**: In the Tembo dashboard, mark issues as "Not a Problem" to help train the AI

3. **Review Query Context**: Some slow queries might be intentional (like reporting queries that run infrequently)

### Performance and Monitoring

#### Slow Issue Processing

**Problem**: Issues are taking a long time to be resolved or pull requests aren't being created promptly.

**Debugging Steps**:

1. **Check Queue Status**: Review the job queue in your dashboard for processing delays
2. **Review AI Solver Status**: Ensure the AI solvers are responding correctly
3. **Examine Issue Complexity**: Complex issues naturally take longer to resolve
4. **Credit Usage**: Verify you haven't hit your credit limits

#### Missing Monitoring Data

**Problem**: Dashboard shows incomplete or missing performance data.

**Solutions**:

1. **Database Statistics Collection**: Ensure `track_activities` and `track_counts` are enabled:

   ```sql
   SHOW track_activities;  -- Should be 'on'
   SHOW track_counts;      -- Should be 'on'
   SHOW track_io_timing;   -- Should be 'on' for detailed I/O stats
   ```

2. **Statistics Reset**: Check if statistics were recently reset:

   ```sql
   SELECT stats_reset FROM pg_stat_database WHERE datname = current_database();
   ```

3. **Connection Monitoring**: Verify Tembo can maintain persistent connections to your database

### Pull Request Issues

#### PRs Not Being Created

**Problem**: Tembo detects issues and generates solutions but doesn't create pull requests.

**Troubleshooting**:

1. **Repository Permissions**: Verify write access to the target repository
2. **Base Branch**: Ensure the default branch exists and is accessible
3. **File Conflicts**: Check if there are uncommitted changes that might cause conflicts
4. **Rate Limits**: GitHub API rate limits might be affecting PR creation

#### Poor Quality Pull Requests

**Problem**: Generated pull requests don't solve the issue or introduce new problems.

**Improvement Steps**:

1. **Provide Feedback**: Use PR comments to guide the AI on what needs improvement
2. **Add Context**: Ensure your repository has good documentation and clear code patterns
3. **Review Patterns**: Look for patterns in poor solutions and provide feedback through the dashboard
4. **Custom Instructions**: Consider adding a `.tembo/instructions.md` file with project-specific guidance

### Best Practices for Troubleshooting

#### Enable Detailed Logging

For PostgreSQL monitoring:

```sql
-- Enable query logging for analysis
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_statement = 'all';
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_duration = on;
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_min_duration_statement = 100;  -- Log queries >100ms
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```

#### Regular Health Checks

1. **Weekly Reviews**: Check the Tembo dashboard weekly for any stuck issues or integration problems
2. **Monitor Integration Status**: Verify all integrations show "Connected" status
3. **Review Recent PRs**: Examine recent pull requests for quality and accuracy
4. **Check Credit Usage**: Monitor your credit consumption to avoid service interruptions

#### Getting Help

If you continue experiencing issues:

1. **Check Status Page**: Visit our status page for known issues or maintenance
2. **Review Documentation**: Ensure you're following the latest setup instructions
3. **Contact Support**: Use the support chat in your Tembo dashboard with:
   - Specific error messages
   - Screenshots of the issue
   - Your organization ID
   - Steps to reproduce the problem

## Performance Optimization Tips

### Database Monitoring Efficiency

- Use connection pooling for high-traffic databases
- Configure appropriate `shared_preload_libraries` for monitoring extensions
- Regularly update table statistics: `ANALYZE;`
- Monitor `pg_stat_statements` for storage growth and reset when needed

### Integration Optimization

- Map only active repositories to reduce noise
- Configure appropriate issue severity thresholds
- Use `.temboignore` files to exclude irrelevant code
- Regularly review and clean up outdated integrations
