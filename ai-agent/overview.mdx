Tembo's agent is a full-stack software engineer powered by AI. It contains a sophisticated a system that finds, fixes, and creates pull requests.

Tembo's built on:

- A powerful language model tuned for software maintenance and code generation
- Real-time signal ingestion from tools like Sentry and Github (see [integrations](/integrations))
- A review-quality PR generation engine

It's the tireless junior deveveloper who actually closes tickets.

## How the Agent Works

Tembo turns noisy alerts and performance signals into real code fixes:

1. **Ingests Signals**\
   Pulls from logs, error trackers, and database metrics (e.g. Sentry, Datadog)

2. **Triages Autonomously**\
   Detects root causes, prioritizes issues, and builds a fix plan without waiting for a ticket

3. **Writes Pull Requests**\
   Generates clean, merge-ready PRs that align with your repo’s best practices

4. **Seeks Approval**\
   You stay in control — approve, reject, or modify the fix before it merges

## What Tembo Can Fix

Tembo specializes in database performance and application reliability issues:

### Database Performance Issues

- **Slow Queries** - Identifies queries with high execution times (>100ms by default) and optimizes them
- **Missing Indexes** - Detects tables that would benefit from indexing and creates appropriate indexes
- **Unused Indexes** - Finds indexes that aren't being used and removes them to improve write performance

### Application Errors

- **Sentry Errors** - Automatically pulls application errors from Sentry and fixes the underlying code issues
- **Stack Traces** - Analyzes error patterns and implements proper error handling

### Code Quality Issues

- **TODO Comments** - Finds TODO items in your codebase and implements the requested functionality
- **Code Bugs** - Uses AI to scan code files and detect potential bugs or performance issues
- **Linear Tickets** - Syncs with Linear project management to implement features and fixes

### Integration Support

Tembo connects to your existing tools:
- PostgreSQL databases (including AWS RDS and Supabase)
- GitHub repositories for pull request creation
- Sentry for error monitoring
- Linear for project management

> Tembo focuses on production issues that impact performance and reliability, automatically creating pull requests with the fixes your team needs.

## Tembo Adapts to Your Workflow

Tembo learns and adapts as it works:

- **Context-aware learning** from your codebase, stack, and issue history
- **Cross-team intelligence** from similar fixes applied across the platform
- **Human-in-the-loop feedback** to improve future PR quality
- **Regular updates** from the latest database, observability, and performance research

## Interacting With Tembo

Use Tembo on your terms:

- **Slack:** Get alerts and fixes where your team already lives
- **GitHub:** Review PRs as if they came from a wildly intelligent junior teammate
- **Web Dashboard:** See what’s been fixed, what’s coming next, and approve changes

### Solution Review and Approval

While Tembo can work autonomously, you maintain control through your workflow toggle:

1. The agent detects an issue and generates a solution
2. You receive a notification with details and recommendations
3. You can approve, reject, or modify the proposed solution
4. Upon approval, the agent implements the changes
