<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What managed Postgres providers do you support?">
    Initially [AWS RDS for PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/)
    and [Tembo Cloud](https://cloud.tembo.io). Other providers coming soon.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't <Cursor|Lovable|Github Copilot> just do this?">
    Yes and no. Horizontal AI engineers are designed to handle any coding task 
    you throw at them. But **you** have to do the throwing. This human-led 
    workflow is great for new products and new features. Coding agents can fix 
    performance issues too, if you specifically ask them to. But you likely won't, 
    because you're consumed with building new features and (reluctantly) fixing bugs. 
    dba handles performance engineering autonomously â€” detecting issues, gathering 
    context and best practices, and submitting code fixes to you. It's not magic, 
    it's just a continuous engine with the right inputs that produces excellent PRs.
  <Accordion title="How do you keep the AI models up-to-date with the latest documentation?">
    **dba** leverages powerful foundational from Anthropic and OpenAI. We also
    regularly ingest platform documentation, Postgres documentation, and other
    sources of knowledge for the latest Postgres techniques.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I bring my own <LLM|LLM KEY>?">
    Yes. LLM rate limits are dba's primary product bottleneck. If you're willing 
    to bring your own Anthropic key, you'll get a fastpass through the waitlist. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are there size limits for code indexing?">
    Code repos are limited to 10,000 files, though this can be adjusted. To
    optimize indexing performance, you can use .dbaignore to exclude unnecessary
    files from the indexing process.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can one database be linked to multipe code repos?">
    Yes, you can map databases to multiple code repos, and vice versa. It's a
    many-to-many relationship.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="### What is the disposition of dba? Is it cheerful or grumpy?">
    ðŸ˜‚ You'll see.
