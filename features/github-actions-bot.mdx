The `Enable GithubActionsBot` feature allows GitHub Actions to interact with Tembo's pull requests and issue management system.

## Overview

When enabled, this feature allows GitHub Actions bot (`github-actions[bot]`) to:

- Comment on pull requests created by Tembo
- Trigger Tembo responses through mentions (@tembo)
- Provide automated feedback and status updates
- Participate in the pull request review process

## How It Works

### Bot Recognition

Tembo maintains a list of accepted bots that can interact with Tembo per Organization. When `Github Actions Bot` is enabled, the `github-actions[bot]` user is added to this accepted list.

### Webhook Processing

When GitHub Actions creates comments or performs actions on pull requests, the webhook handler checks if the action comes from an accepted bot. If `Github Actions Bot` is enabled, GitHub Actions comments are processed and can trigger Tembo responses.

### Permission Model

GitHub Actions bot interactions are subject to the same permission model as other bots:

- Must mention @tembo or @tembo-io to trigger responses
- Only works on pull requests created by Tembo
- Respects the `maxBotReviews` setting to prevent excessive automated interactions

## Configuration

### Default Setting

- **Default Value:** `true`
- **Type:** Boolean
- **Scope:** Organization-level setting

### Web Interface

The setting can be configured through the web interface:

1. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Pull Requests**
2. Find the **Bot Interactions** section
3. Toggle the **GitHub Actions** switch

## Use Cases

### CI/CD Integration

- GitHub Actions can report build status on Tembo PRs
- Automated test results can be communicated to Tembo
- Deployment status updates can trigger follow-up actions

### Quality Assurance

- Automated code quality checks can provide feedback
- Security scans can report vulnerabilities
- Performance benchmarks can be shared

### Workflow Automation

- GitHub Actions can trigger additional Tembo reviews
- Status updates can influence PR prioritization
- Automated approvals for low-risk changes

## Security Considerations

### Bot Verification

The system specifically checks for the `github-actions[bot]` username to ensure only legitimate GitHub Actions can interact with Tembo.

### Rate Limiting

The `maxBotReviews` setting prevents excessive automated interactions, protecting against potential spam or infinite loops.

### Permission Inheritance

GitHub Actions bot inherits the same permission model as other automated systems, ensuring consistent security policies.

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Actions Not Responding

1. Verify `Github Actions Bot` is set to `true`
2. Check that comments mention @tembo or @tembo-io
3. Ensure the PR was created by Tembo
4. Verify the `maxBotReviews` limit hasn't been exceeded

### Unexpected Behavior

1. Check webhook logs for processing errors
2. Verify GitHub Actions permissions in the repository
3. Ensure the GitHub App installation has proper permissions
