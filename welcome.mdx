title: 'What is Tembo?'
---

Tembo monitors your stack, fixes bugs, and submits production-ready pull requests, asynchronously.

Create [workflows](/workflows) that automatically handle code maintenance, bug fixes, system optimizations and more. When an engineering issue occurs, Tembo solves it with AI.

## How it works

Tembo is powered by AI to:

1. **Monitor your entire stack** - Automatically detect issues across your code, database, and infrastructure
2. **Analyze and prioritize** - Intelligently assess impact and determine priority without human intervention
3. **Generate and test fixes** - Create and validate solutions for identified problems
4. **Submit pull requests** - Provide production-ready code changes for your review

**Fix problems before you notice them**

> Tembo detects and resolves issues across your system—code, database, and infrastructure—automatically.

**Speed up shipping**

> Engineers stay focused on building new features while Tembo handles maintenance tasks.

**Multiply your team's output**

> Reduce your maintenance workload by up to 85% with autonomous bug fixing.

## Workflows

Each workflow follows a simple pattern:

1. **Trigger**: "When this happens..." (e.g., new bug report, performance issue, alert)
2. **Conditions**: "If these conditions are met..." (e.g., high priority, specific labels)
3. **Actions**: "Then do this..." (e.g., analyze, fix, create PR)

Tembo works with two powerful approaches:

- **Self-Initiated/Autonomous Fixing**: Tembo detects issues and initiates fixes without manual assignments
- **Team-Initiated/Manual Assignment**: Your team assigns specific issues for Tembo to work on
